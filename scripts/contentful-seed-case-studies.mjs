// - Gulbaan (from the first, hard-coded build of the page). PLACEHOLDER copy: most section text
//   is lorem ipsum, and "The Idea Behind Gulbaan" describes another project.
// - Terminal Gateway CRM (from CRM-terminalgateway-case-study.svg). PLACEHOLDER copy: the
//   design's text came from another agency's case study, so titles and features are neutral
//   stand-ins based on the product screens, and paragraphs are lorem ipsum.
// Replace the text in Contentful before launch.
// Usage: npm run contentful:seed-case-studies
// (needs the model: migrations 0002, 0003, and 0004)
// Everything has a fixed id, so running it again skips what already exists.
